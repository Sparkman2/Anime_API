# Anime_API

Using Jikan API, https://jikan.moe, this application helps you find the anime that you like! You can search for anime, check the top-rated anime, or get suggestions for random animes using the generator!

# Setting Up

Firstly make sure you have node.js installed on your computer

1. Download the zip file in GitHub and extract and set the folder in your desktop, it should be called Anime_API-main. You can rename this to anything you like

2. Open up your terminal and get into the folder Anime_API-main using the cd commands. 

3. Write this line in the command line "node server.js". You should see a message that says "Server on 3000"

4. Lastly, go to http://localhost:3000 and explore the website!

# Things I learned and struggled with

I learned EJS framework as well as Jest testing. They were both pretty simple to get the hang of and it was easy to work with.

The CSS styles sheet was not working with my EJS template, so I had to transition and just add style to each EJS template individually. However, I would've wanted to make a singular style sheet.
