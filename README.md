# Things I learned and struggled with

Learned EJS framework as well as Jest testing. They were both pretty simple to get the hang of and it was easy to work with.

The CSS styles sheet was not working with my EJS template, so I had to transition and just add style to each EJS template individually. However, I wouldve definetly wanted to make a singular styles sheet.
